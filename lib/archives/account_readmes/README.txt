= Account & Trust Factor Documentation =

This documentation will document and explain this part of the bot

== What is this? ==

Users must register in order to use certain commands. The reason is so that there will not be misuse of the service. 
However, for commands that do not require much resources, this restriction will not be in place. 

== Account Registration ==

Using the "register" command, the user's data will be preset to the following values:

registrationLevel: 1
trust: 1

== Trust Factor == 

All users registered will have a trust value of 1 with a max trust value of 10. User's trust factor can increase or decrease on random.
With a higher trust value means you are elligible for the following:

1. Certain cooldown bypasses
2. More command access
3. Moderation of bot logs
And other benefits...

If a user's trust factor reaches 0 or drops by 3 or more in a single setting. That user's account will be then deactivated meaning they
will be blacklisted and have been using much of the bot's features.

== Manual Account Deactivation == 

A user can choose to also remove their account from the account listing. Doing so would remove their trust factor and reset them to an
unregistered user. This action cannot be undone.
